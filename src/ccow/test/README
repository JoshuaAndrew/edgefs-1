===========================================================

All new features require regressions tests and must :
1. added to tap_steps.txt to enable the test
/opt/nedge/scripts/autotest/tests/cf_build_verification/tap_steps.txt
2. Run at least twice and must clean up after themselves.
3. Each test must be somewhat short running < 1min
4. Must test actual buffers and not simply the return code of a function!!

If your test does not meet each of the above, exceptions can be made and
coverage should be moved elsewhere i.e. testlink for QA or automation within QA
